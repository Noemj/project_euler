* The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

* Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

* Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
